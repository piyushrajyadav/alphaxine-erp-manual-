- **Format:** firstname.lastname (e.g., john.smith)
- **Characters:** Use only letters, numbers, periods, or underscores
- **Case:** Usually lowercase (john.smith, not JOHN.SMITH)
- **Length:** Keep it 6-20 characters

**📍 How to Create User ID:**
1. Take employee's first name: John
2. Add a period: John.
3. Add last name: John.Smith
4. Make it lowercase: john.smith
5. Check if it already exists in system
6. If exists, add number: john.smith2

**🔐 Password Management Guide:**

**Option 1: Temporary Password Method (Recommended)**
```
Step 1: Set a standard temporary password
Examples: Welcome@123, Company@2025, TempPass@456

Step 2: Force password change on first login
- Employee MUST change password when they first login
- System should not let them proceed until they create new password

Step 3: Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least 1 number (0-9)
- At least 1 special character (!@#$%^&*)
```

**Option 2: System Generated Password**
```
Let the system create a random secure password like:
- Kf9$mN2p
- Bx7@wR4q
- Qs3#nL8v

Pros: Very secure
Cons: Hard for employees to remember
```

**Option 3: Employee Self-Setup**
```
Send employee an email with setup link:
"Click here to set up your account password"

Pros: Employee chooses memorable password
Cons: Requires email system integration
```

**🎯 Recommended Approach for Small Companies:**
1. **User ID:** firstname.lastname format
2. **Password:** Start with Welcome@123
3. **First Login:** Employee must change password
4. **Requirements:** Enforce strong password rules
